DSL for generating js code
Name: Svetlana
Take x as list and y as number
then look `or see` if x instance has foo as property
then add to holder as foo plus index
then  save to local as previous label
then finally `related to last if; also it is the end of the loop started with see * INPUT instance` set to final someother
then look within x as first temp list 
then look within first temp as second temp object
then log first and second temp with indexes
then filter if second temp has boolean property circus
and first temp index is bigger than some constant
as third temp
then finally create fourth temp with some predicate
then create final long words 
such as x instance prop length is bigger than constant limit
then create final  baboon
such as x instance prop sk with prop length is there
then create final  bear
such as x instance prop passes some function
